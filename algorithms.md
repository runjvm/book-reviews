Review list
- Introdution to Algorithms, Third Edition (AKA CLRS)
	- Not as systematic as "Algorithms". Points are often hidden in the middle of a paragraph
	- Sometime goes to great details on some topic
    - All the proofs are worth reading
- Algorithms (Princeton)
	- Clearer; Easier to read, such as using 2-3 tree to illustrate red-black tree
    - In contrast, some topics are not as deep as "Introdution to Algorithms, Third Edition"
- The Art of Computer Programming
	- Much older than the rest two
    - Very personal. Not designed for being a texbook
    - has a lot of interesting comments. Feel like Knuth is chatting with you
    
Introdution to Algorithms vs. Algorithms is like the Dragon book vs Engineering a Compiler.
